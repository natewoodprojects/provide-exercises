### Rails

**Language: Rails (i.e., Ruby)**

In a Ruby file (or a few Ruby files), write Rails code that could be used in a
application that does url shortening.

- The application creates _short_ URLs for any given long URL.
  - Given `https://www.example.com/some-long-url` we will get
    back a short URL like `https://lend.to/x1y2z3`
  - Visiting the short URL redirects us to the longer URL
  - The application tracks how often a short URL is used

The point of this exercise is to start a conversation about coding in Rails.
Think about where you put code, how it might be re-used elsewhere, and just
overall design of a "real application."
