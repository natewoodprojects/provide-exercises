### Algorithm

**Language: Any language**

In a language of your choice, implement an algorithm that, when
given a string, returns the longest repeating substring found in the input.
E.g., in the string "phenomenal", the longest repeating substring is "en".

Part of this work is to be able to talk about algorithmic complexity.
This particular problem has quite a few different solutions, and each
of them have trade-offs in both time and memory costs.
