Hi Nate,

Sorry for the delay! We had our on-site in SF last week, which distracted me more than anticipated. Anyway, I'm back now and looking forward to moving forward with you.

I've attached the zip of the exercises, but please don't worry; I don't expect you to complete all of them. 

You can start with the url-shortener exercise, and then if you have time, take a look at the object-oriented exercise. 

The temp-component exercise is fun if you still have time after that and want to show off your Javascript skills.

Let me know if you have any questions!

Best,
Chris
