### List Components

**Language: JavaScript + HTML (or a templating system)**

In the `list-components` directory, create one or more components to render a list of items. Feel free to use any libraries or frameworks for this exercise, but assume that a reasonable build process is in place for the tools you choose. We don’t want you spending time to setup a fresh Ember/React/Vue/etc application, so don’t worry about getting the component actually rendering in a browser.

This directory contains the `db.json` file which provides the data structure to be used to render a list component. Make reasonable assumptions about the purpose of this data.

#### Requirements:
- All attributes of the provided data must be used (heading, body, item titles, etc.)
- There must be a toggle button to collapse/expand the items in a list

The purpose of this exercise is to start a conversation around building modular JavaScript applications. Styling and CSS is not required, but feel free to add whatever code you feel will help facilitate this conversation.
