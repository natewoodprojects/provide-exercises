## Math Function

**Language: Any language**

In the `math-function` directory, implement a function that fulfills the requirements below.

### Requirements

>A train leaves the train station at 12:00 PM traveling north at 35 mph.
>A second train leaves the same station at 12:15 PM traveling west at 45 mph.
>Write a function that takes a time `t` that represents minutes since 12:00 PM,
>and returns the distance in miles the two trains are from each other at that time `t`.

### Hint

Use the [Pythagorean theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem) to calculate the distance between the two trains:
a<sup>2</sup> + b<sup>2</sup> = c<sup>2</sup>
