### Style Cleanup

**Language: HTML + CSS**

The `index.html` page contains markup for a prototype of a new component. Make as many improvements to it as you would like. Feel free to change anything in the markup or css. Design changes are also welcome, as long as all the elements of the UI are still represented.

This should have reasonable support for modern browsers.

Feel free to edit either the `index.css` file directly, or if you prefer, edit and compile `index.scss`. SASS can be compiled with http://sass.js.org/ or on the command line with libsass.

```bash
brew install sassc
sassc index.scss index.css
```
